**Eteco** is an initiative developed by students from ETEC Deputado Salim Sedeh, in Leme-SP, aiming to face the growing challenge of inadequate disposal of electro-electronic waste. The project was born from the need to connect the population to the correct collection points, promoting environmental preservation and public health through technology.

The platform centralizes information on where and how to dispose of unused devices, offering interactive tools that facilitate the user's journey in search of a more sustainable attitude.

### Technical Challenges and Learning

The development of Eteco involved overcoming significant technical obstacles, consolidating advanced knowledge in software architecture and systems integration.

1. **Automated News Update:** The implementation of **Puppeteer** in the backend allowed for automated collection (scraping) of environmental news from reliable sources, ensuring the portal is always updated without constant manual intervention.
2. **Data Consistency with TypeScript:** Using TypeScript throughout the ecosystem (frontend and backend) was crucial to ensure data security and reduce typing errors, especially in the integration with the MySQL database via Zod for validation.
3. **Animations and Living Interface:** The use of **Framer Motion** allowed for the creation of smooth transitions and visual states that make navigation more engaging and intuitive, raising the aesthetic standard of the academic project.
