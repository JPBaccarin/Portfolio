### Technical and Design Challenges

As a project developed within the **High School** context, the focus was to demonstrate how technology can be applied to solve complex informational problems, such as internationalization research.

1. **Data Consolidation:** The biggest challenge was gathering and structuring diverse data from multiple countries into a coherent database schema using Sequelize, ensuring accurate comparisons.
2. **Animations and Feedback:** The implementation of Framer Motion allowed for smooth transitions that make navigating through dense data much friendlier and less tiring for the user.
3. **Code Organization:** Choosing a TypeScript environment on both ends (Client and Server) ensured greater data traffic security and facilitated long-term project maintenance.
