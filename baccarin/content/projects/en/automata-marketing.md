### Technical & Design Challenges

As the person responsible for **UI/UX and Development**, the main goal was to deliver an impactful visual experience without compromising usability or technical performance.

1. **Animation Orchestration:** Integrating GSAP in a React/Next.js environment required careful management of the DOM lifecycle to ensure fluid, non-blocking animations across different browsers.
2. **Experience Design (UI/UX):** I designed the interface in Figma focusing on an intuitive navigation that leads the user through the agency's portfolio, using movement as a narrative tool and not just an adornment.
3. **Cross-browser Fidelity:** Ensuring that complex motion paths and layout transitions remained consistent across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, especially on mobile devices.
