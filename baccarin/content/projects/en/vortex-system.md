# Vortex System

Vortex System was developed as a proof of concept for visualizing large volumes of data (Big Data) in minimalist interfaces.

## The Challenge

The main challenge was to maintain browser performance while rendering thousands of points in a GSAP/Three.js environment.

## Digital Solution

We used a hybrid rendering approach and custom shaders to create the "Perlin noise" effect you see in the background.

### Features:

- Real-time rendering.
- Deep integration with GSAP.
- Industrial gray aesthetic with orange accents.
- Static export via Next.js.
