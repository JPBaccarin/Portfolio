### 💡 Technical Challenges & Leadership

As **Project Lead**, I managed a team of 5 people, being responsible for System Design, Database modeling, and Full-stack architecture. The main challenges overcome were:

1. **Performance Optimization:** I reduced the initial loading time from **2 minutes to just 40 seconds**, applying Server-Side Rendering (SSR) techniques and optimizing native Next.js images and fonts.
2. **API Cost Management:** I implemented caching strategies and prompt refinement to minimize the consumption of OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs, ensuring the project's financial viability.
3. **Team Leadership:** Coordination of sprints, code review, and alignment between the design and development areas to ensure delivery within the deadline.
