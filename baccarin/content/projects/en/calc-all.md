    CalcAll - Project Documentation
    This file follows the institutional portfolio standard.
    First relevant project, awarded in 2022 and the basis for the LearnSpace project.
-->

**CalcAll** was my first major software development project, created in 2022 during the Systems Development technical course (MTEC). The project stood out in science fairs, winning 1st place in the devCoffee Award and serving as a solid foundation for the later development of my final project (TCC), **LearnSpace**.

The platform was born from the need to simplify physics study for high school students, offering an intuitive interface where it is possible to calculate various kinematics variables and review fundamental concepts.

### Key Features

- **Kinematics Calculations:** Dedicated tools to solve Uniform Motion (UM), Uniformly Varied Motion (UVM), and Vertical Motion (VM) problems.
- **Simplified Theory:** Integrated educational articles explaining physical concepts, facilitating theoretical understanding before practical application.
- **Award-Winning Interface:** Design focused on user experience (UX), using modern Bootstrap components to ensure information clarity and organization.
- **Variable Versatility:** The system logic allows calculating different variables (displacement, time, velocity, acceleration) depending on the data provided by the user.

### Technical and Design Challenges

As an initial milestone in my academic and professional career, CalcAll presented challenges that shaped my understanding of web development.

1. **Mathematical Logic in JS:** Implementing functions that rearrange physics formulas to find the desired unknown variable required rigorous logical thinking and constant precision testing.
2. **Modularization with SASS:** Using SASS allowed for more professional organization of styles, facilitating maintenance and creating consistent visual themes across all pages.
3. **Interactivity and UX:** Ensuring that students received calculation feedback clearly and quickly was a priority, avoiding common confusion in complex calculation tools.
